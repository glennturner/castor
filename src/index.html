        </p><p>Caroline Williams is a screenwriter originally from Atlanta, Georgia. In 2008 she created the ABC series&nbsp;<em>Miss Guided</em>&nbsp;starring Judy Greer and Chris Parnell, about a high school guidance counselor who must relive her unpopular high school days when another old classmate joins the faculty and staff. From there, Caroline went on to write for&nbsp;<em>The Office</em>,&nbsp;<em>Modern Family</em>,&nbsp;<em>Up All Night</em>,&nbsp;<em>BoJack Horseman</em>&nbsp;and others including, most recently,&nbsp;<em>Arrested Development</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Maniac</em>&nbsp;for Netflix.

          96 'Dead &amp; Buried' with 'Riot Girls' Director Jovanka Vuckovic
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Jovanka Vuckovic is an award-winning filmmaker and writer. In the past two decades, she has worked as a visual effects artist, earning a Gemini Award, and cemented a reputation as a genre film authority—she was twice named one of the most important women in the history of horror, serving for a time as editor-in-chief of famed Rue Morgue Magazine. In 2016, she spread her wings into the US film market, joining the DGA after directing a segment of&nbsp;<em>XX</em>, the first-ever all-female horror film anthology from Magnolia Pictures, which had its premiere at Sundance 2017. Her debut&nbsp;<em>Riot Girls</em>, written by Katherine Collins, will see its release this year. The film tells the story of two young women who must save a young man from the clutches of a little psychopath on the wrong side of Potter’s Bluff — a town divided after a mysterious disease wiped out all the adults.</p> <p>The movie that Jovanka has chosen to discuss is a grossly underappreciated classic - 1981's&nbsp;<em>Dead &amp; Buried</em>. Jovanka talks about how she named the small town of Potter's Bluff in&nbsp;<em>Riot Girls</em>&nbsp;after the Potter's Bluff of&nbsp;<em>Dead &amp; Buried</em>. She even goes as far to say she envisions that both films exist in the exact same town. Jovanka also opens up about her intense fear of death and how that influences her films. And she and April discuss the struggles of getting a movie made as a female filmmaker.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QyiF_QjW_M"><em>Riot Girls</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters and on demand on September 13th.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tp7l7g5ZM8"><em>Dead &amp; Buried</em></a>&nbsp;yet, you simply must!</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JovankaVuckovic">Jovanka Vuckovic</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

Starting her career in photography, she graduated from New York’s School of Visual Arts and embedded herself in fascinating communities for photo series that culminated in two photo books. In 2018, Liza received the prestigious Sundance Documentary Fund grant for her film&nbsp;<em>Jawline</em>, following a handful of online teen heartthrob boys to chronicle the curious rise of a burgeoning yet fleeting economy.&nbsp;<em>Jawline</em>&nbsp;premiered at Sundance Film Festival and went on to win the Special Jury Award for Emerging Filmmaker. She was also named by Filmmaker magazine as one of the 25 New Faces of Independent Cinema in 2018 and one of 10 Documentary Filmmakers to Watch by Variety.</p> <p>The movie that Liza chose to discuss ties in effortlessly with her own film&nbsp;<em>Jawline</em>&nbsp;- that would be 1988's dark comedy&nbsp;<em>Heathers</em>. April and Liza discuss the nature of being a teenager and just how serious everything feels. Liza talks about interviewing all the wannabe influencers for her film&nbsp;<em>Jawline</em>&nbsp;and how, no matter the place, everyone dressed the exact same. She also discusses the effects of "follow culture" and how that is demonstrated in both&nbsp;<em>Heathers</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Jawline</em>.</p> <p>You can stream&nbsp;<em>Jawline</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hulu.com/watch/97faaa95-943e-4258-9573-bac4790d5f42">Hulu</a>&nbsp;now.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EsMeYlzwCU"><em>Heathers</em></a>&nbsp;yet, watch it now!</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/lizamandelup">Liza Mandelup</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

          94 'Hereditary' with 'Pet Sematary' Director Mary Lambert
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Mary Lambert is an Arkansas native and a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design. There she became enfolded in the music scene, and her experimental shorts led her to the world of music videos. In her early career, she directed some of the most iconic videos of the time. A short list of these includes Janet Jackson’s “Control” and “Nasty Boys,” Madonna’s “Borderline,” “Like a Virgin,” “Material Girl,” “La Isla Bonita,” and “Like a Prayer.” Other artists include Tom Tom Club, Whitney Houston, The Go-Gos, Sting, Annie Lennox, and Debbie Harry. From there, Lambert ventured into feature films with her debut narrative,&nbsp;<em>Siesta</em>, an adaptation of Patrice Chapman’s novel by Patricia Knop. After that film, Lambert went back to music videos until she got the call that Stephen King was adapting his book&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>. She got the big OK from King and&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>&nbsp;was a hit. Most recently Lambert directed episodes of&nbsp;<em>Step Up: High Water</em>,&nbsp;<em>Arrow</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Blacklist</em>.</p> <p>The movie that Mary chose to discuss is TOO scary. She chose Ari Aster's&nbsp;<em>Hereditary</em>. Mary gets mystical on us - she examines witches, spells, and the subconscious tokens in art that are felt and not spoken. Plus, she talks about working with actors that have very different approaches. She and April dissect the inner workings of a melodrama. They celebrate the performances in&nbsp;<em>Hereditary</em>, particularly Milly Shapiro and Toni Collette. And Mary reveals the difficulty in cutting something she loves out of one of her projects.</p> <p>You can stream&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMao8sg4DPA"><em>Pet Sematary</em></a>&nbsp;now.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6wWKNij_1M"><em>Hereditary</em></a>&nbsp;yet, be careful.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TheMaryLambert">Mary Lambert</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

Emma shares how many of these attributes inspired her decisions on&nbsp;<em>The Wind</em>. Plus, Katie reveals some hilariously volatile memos between producer David O. Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock.

        </p><p>Mitzi Peirone was born and raised in Turin, Italy. After high school Peirone left Italy to study theater in New York City at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She ended up writing and directing a short film called “Chaosmos,” and directing another short called “Versperlings” while she geared up for a feature. The screenplay for&nbsp;<em>Braid</em>&nbsp;rapidly became her main focus, and in 2016 Peirone partnered up with entrepreneur Joseph Lubin to create a new business model to finance her film, which became the first one ever to be fully financed through a cryptocurrency equity crowdsale. The sale raised 1.7 million dollars in two weeks. The film premiered at Tribeca in 2018 and won Best Picture at the Lausanne Underground Film Festival.&nbsp;<em>Braid</em>, which tells the story of two women who decide to rob their wealthy psychotic friend - but must participate in the friend’s perverse game of make believe, received worldwide distribution via Blue Fox Entertainment. Mitzi then signed with ICM, and her next directorial effort is a sci-fi thriller set in a tech-apocalypse, starring Bella Thorne.</p> <p>The movie Mitzi chose to discuss this week is a real mind bender - 2001's cult classic,&nbsp;<em>Donnie Darko</em>. Part of the reason that Mitzi loves this film is that, much like her own movie&nbsp;<em>Braid</em>, it can be hard to tell what is real and what is imagined. She discusses her unusual fundraising technique for the movie which involved a cryptocurrency equity crowdsale. Mitzi also emphasizes the need for filmmakers not to concern themselves with whether the audience will completely understand their vision. Plus, she talks at length about her belief that there is no difference between reality and dreams - a conversation that makes April's brain explode.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgUW_SjWGdI"><em>Braid</em></a>&nbsp;streaming now.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZyBaFYFySk"><em>Donnie Darko</em></a>&nbsp;yet, go watch it!</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5625526/">Mitzi Peirone</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

          88 'Drop Dead Gorgeous' with 'Grown-ish' Writers Melanie Kirschbaum &amp; Alexandra Decas
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Melanie Kirschbaum started her LA career working for Jeff and Jackie Filgo, and then Vali Chandrasekaran on&nbsp;<em>Modern Family</em>, while Alexandra Decas was with Jonathan Groff on&nbsp;<em>Black-ish</em>. The two met when their bosses were working on a pilot together, and they decided to join forces when they found themselves standing outside of their offices at Disney, bemoaning their crappy Tinder matches. They wondered, presumably aloud, "If Elizabeth Smart has it all figured out — a husband, a career, great hair — what’s our excuse?" So they wrote a one-act play entitled "Smart" to get to the bottom of it, as well as a comedic one-act about 9/11 called "Center of the Universe." After that, they joined the Netflix/Dreamworks show&nbsp;<em>The Boss Baby: Back in Business</em>&nbsp;as staff writers, but then hit some network gold when they were staffed on the critically acclaimed hit show&nbsp;<em>Grown-ish</em>, a spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Black-ish</em>&nbsp;that follows Zoey Johnson as she navigates college life.&nbsp;<em>Grown-ish</em>was just renewed for season 3 and can be seen on Freeform.</p> <p>The movie that Alex and Mel have chosen to discuss is an important film for Minnesotans everywhere - 1999's&nbsp;<em>Drop Dead Gorgeous</em>. The two of them and April marvel at the fact that this movie is&nbsp;so&nbsp;inappropriate by today's standards - but still so funny! The two writers open up about how their writing process used to be incredibly unorthodox. One of them is outed as a frequent "office cryer." And, of course, the conversation covers something April is very passionate about - the eyebrow styles of the 1990s.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<em>Grown-ish</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://freeform.go.com/shows/grown-ish">Freeform</a>.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hulu.com/movie/drop-dead-gorgeous-d13f5e93-308c-477b-81ef-fe03e99974ee"><em>Drop Dead Gorgeous&nbsp;</em></a>yet, go watch it!</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/thekirschbaumer?lang=en">Melanie Kirschbaum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/adecas?lang=en">Alexandra Decas</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </p><p>Born in Haiti and raised in small town USA, Numa Perrier is a Los Angeles-based actor, filmmaker, and artist. Early in her acting career, she landed a recurring role on&nbsp;<em>General Hospital</em>, but now you can see her on&nbsp;<em>SMILF</em>&nbsp;and films including&nbsp;<em>Florida Water</em>,&nbsp;<em>Jerico</em>,&nbsp;<em>In The Morning</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Beautiful Destroyer</em>. An early creator in the digital space, she starred in and was co-writer of the web series 'The Couple' which landed an HBO deal. She later started writing a script for her first feature, which would become&nbsp;<em>Jezebel</em>. That project was accepted into the Tribeca Film Institute "Through Her Lens" incubation program. Now&nbsp;<em>Jezebel</em>&nbsp;is premiering at SXSW 2019. The film follows 19-year-old Tiffany as she deals with her dying mother and tries to make ends meet when her older phone sex operator sister grooms her to become one of the first black webcam girls in the 1990s.</p> <p>The movie that Numa has chosen to discuss is a classic - 1972's&nbsp;<em>Blacula</em>. She and April go deep on their discussion of William Marshall's intense, Shakespearean portrayal of the eponymous vampire. Plus, they dissect how radical this film was in terms of its portrayal of black men on screen. Numa opens up about the making of her own movie,&nbsp;<em>Jezebel</em>. She gives some great advice on filming and completing a micro-budget film. Plus, she discusses the double standard that low budget black filmmakers face versus their white counterparts.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2019/02/jezebel-clip-sxsw-numa-perrier-tiffany-tenille-1202561223/"><em>Jezebel</em></a>&nbsp;out this fall.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRl2Kd5UtSc"><em>Blacula</em></a>&nbsp;yet, go watch it!</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/missnuma">Numa Perrier</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </p><p>Kelli first got her big break in daytime TV, both as the evil adolescent Kimberly in&nbsp;<em>Ryan's Hope</em>&nbsp;and then as vengeful Tina in&nbsp;<em>One Life to Live</em>. Her film debut as the ‘Spirit Bunny’ Cindy Carr in&nbsp;<em>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</em>&nbsp;caught a lot of attention, but Kelli achieved her greatest enduring cult popularity with her delightful turn as the endearingly spunky Samantha in the science-fiction end-of-the-world&nbsp;<em>Night of the Comet</em>. She’s especially memorable as the sweet, killer-robot slayer Alison Parks in the entertaining romp, cult classic&nbsp;<em>Chopping Mall</em>, and as Jamie, a strong female survivor in&nbsp;<em>The Zero Boys</em>, as well as many other films.</p> <p>The movie that Kelli has chosen to discuss is especially prescient because our host April Wolfe just happens to be writing the remake of the film. That's right, Kelli has chosen to discuss the 1974 classic,&nbsp;<em>Black Christmas</em>. She and April discuss Kelli's career in horror, and how Kelli takes great joy from the fact that horror has recently received the respect it has always deserved. She also talks about "embracing her crap" and coming to terms with the fact that she is most remembered for her cult and horror films. But she also elaborates on how honored she is by the support she receives from the fans of her work, and how meaningful that relationship is to her. Plus, she has a great story about how an off-the-cuff line she said while shooting a machine gun became one of&nbsp;<em>Night of the Comet</em>'s most famous lines.</p> <p>If you haven't seen any of Kelli's films,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F13mpUTYS3E"><em>Night of the Comet</em></a>&nbsp;is a great place to start.</p> <p>And go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6JuJHmVsh4"><em>Black Christmas</em></a>&nbsp;too, while you're at it.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Kellimaroney">Kelli Maroney</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </p><p>Aline began her screenwriting career in 1999 with her first produced feature, the romantic comedy&nbsp;<em>Three to Tango</em>, starring Neve Campbell. That film established Aline as a go-to writer of realistic drama and romance. She followed that film up with 2004’s&nbsp;<em>Laws of Attraction</em>, starring Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan. But her best known work came with the film adaptation of the popular novel,&nbsp;<em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>, a modern classic, and features one of Meryl Streep’s signature roles as the imperious magazine editor, Miranda Priestly. In 2014, Aline added television to her resume when she co-created the critically acclaimed, Emmy award-winning comedy series,&nbsp;<em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>, on which she served as head writer, showrunner, and executive producer. The series just finished airing its fourth and final season on the CW.</p> <p>The movie that Aline has chosen to discuss is the wonderful Steven Spielberg film,&nbsp;<em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em>. She discusses how the film has become one of her favorites over the years, and one that she admires as a feat of technical storytelling. She dives into the process of working with actors to help change movie scripts on set, like working with Emily Blunt on&nbsp;<em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>to fully develop her character. She elaborates on showrunning&nbsp;<em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>&nbsp;and the insane schedule of producing a musical one hour sitcom. Aline also bemoans the lack of character-driven films that were so prevalent in the '70's, and how she frequently falls asleep during the final fights of Marvel films.</p> <p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80066227">Netflix</a>&nbsp;now.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7-2PB4jj2o"><em>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/alinebmckenna">Aline Brosh McKenna</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

Plus, Guinevere talks about her own process, and how her childhood spent in a cult inspired her newest film&nbsp;<em>Charlie Says</em>. She reveals that she&nbsp;hates&nbsp;it when actors change the dialogue from one of her screenplays, but conversely, as an actress she always asks if she can change lines. She discusses her dislike of tricking actors into performances. And she even touches upon working with Christian Bale on&nbsp;<em>American Psycho</em>&nbsp;and her decades long collaborative relationship with Mary Harron.</p> <p>You can check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPSKkxTQFEU"><em>Charlie Says</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters now.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaOlMIEUeMA&amp;has_verified=1"><em>An American Werewolf in London</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/turnerguinevere?lang=en">Guinevere Turner</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

          79 'The Red Queen Kills Seven Times' with 'Body at Brighton Rock' Director Roxanne Benjamin
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Roxanne Benjamin is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker, who began her career in creative development, analyzing story for film festivals and production companies. In 2010, she moved up the ladder at a company called The Collective, where she went on to produce the well known anthology horror films&nbsp;<em>V/H/S</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>V/H/S/2</em>, which premiered at Sundance Midnights. Roxanne then helmed the short “Don’t Fall”, part of Magnolia Pictures’ all-women-helmed horror anthology,&nbsp;<em>XX</em>. She served double duty on the film, co-writing and producing the segment “The Birthday Party” for musician-turned-director Annie Clark aka St. Vincent.&nbsp;<em>Body at Brighton Rock</em>&nbsp;is her solo feature directorial debut. It tells the story of a young woman working the trails of a mountainous park, who finds a dead body in the middle of nowhere and is given orders to guard the scene, facing down all her worst fears. Roxanne is currently working on a remake of&nbsp;<em>Night of the Comet</em>&nbsp;for Orion Pictures.</p> <p>The movie that Roxanne has chosen to discuss is a giallo classic -&nbsp;<em>The Red Queen Kills Seven Times</em>&nbsp;by Emilio Miraglia. She and April go over all the tenants of the Italian giallo genre - the murder, the fashion, the blood! Roxanne talks about how giallo has influenced the way she works on her own films, and particularly, how she crafts her kills on screen. Plus she goes into detail on the production of her newest film,&nbsp;<em>Body at Brighton Rock</em>, and the "1980's TV movie" look she was going for. She and April also dissect the unfortunate prevalence of rape in the horror genre, and how so often it's disturbingly used as a device to titillate.</p> <p>You can check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXww9NuqUDU"><em>Body at Brighton Rock</em></a>&nbsp;streaming now.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QS4rpjtGxM"><em>The Red Queen Kills Seven Times</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/rox_anne_b">Roxanne Benjamin</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Madeleine Olnek is a New York City based playwright and filmmaker. She began her career with award-winning and widely screened comedy shorts.&nbsp;<em>​Countertransference&nbsp;</em>​(2009) and&nbsp;<em>Hold Up</em>&nbsp;​(2006) were official selections of Sundance, while ​<em>Make Room For Phyllis</em>&nbsp;​(2007) premiered at Sarasota. Olnek was also awarded best female short film director at Sundance in 2009 by LA’s Women In Film organization. Her debut feature, ​<em>Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same</em>, told the story of three lesbian space aliens who come to Earth, and one of them falls in love with an earthling. It ​premiered at Sundance 2011 and is now translated into eleven languages. Her second feature, ​<em>The Foxy Merkins</em>,​ is a kind of buddy-comedy homage about two lesbian prostitutes. She is one of the authors of&nbsp;<em>The Practical Handbook for The Actor</em>&nbsp;(with a foreword by David Mamet), a widely used acting textbook. And now she’s back with her third feature,&nbsp;<em>Wild Nights with Emily</em>, a perhaps more truthful yet comic telling of the life of Emily Dickinson, starring Molly Shannon as the eponymous poet. Madeleine was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship for the completion of the film, so it is a BIG DEAL.</p> <p>The movie that Madeleine has chosen to discuss is one that she calls a "masterpiece." That would be David Lynch's&nbsp;<em>Mulholland Drive</em>. Madeleine likens the film to The Bible in that there are many interpretations that are applicable across generations. She discusses how she is personally connected to the film and how she felt that it truly mirrored her own life. Madeleine even dons David Lynch "our great poet of filmmaking" and explains why this film (and&nbsp;<em>Inland Empire</em>) are his greatest poems. She also discusses why she cast Molly Shannon in her newest film,&nbsp;<em>Wild Nights with Emily</em>. And how most literary adaptations do not properly portray the true words and feelings of a piece of literature. She ends the conversation with explaining why artists have the moral obligation to put humor in their work, and how making a straight drama is not a creative choice.</p> <p>You can check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u36bKgONkfI"><em>Wild Night with Emily</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters now.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbZJ487oJlY"><em>Mulholland Drive</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2112342/">Madeleine Olnek</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </p><p>Amy Seimetz started out writing, directing, and acting in short films and made her feature debut in a pair of films,&nbsp;<em>Black Dragon Canyon</em>&nbsp;and the indie cult hit&nbsp;<em>Wristcutters: A Love Story</em>. She appeared in films such as&nbsp;<em>Gabi on the Roof in July</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tiny Furniture</em>,&nbsp;<em>You're Next</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Myth of the American Sleepover</em>&nbsp;before directing her own feature debut,&nbsp;<em>Sun Don't Shine</em>&nbsp;in 2012. Amy went on to co-create and executive produce the critically acclaimed Starz series&nbsp;<em>The Girlfriend Experience</em>. In 2018, Amy directed two episodes of the acclaimed FX series&nbsp;<em>Atlanta</em>&nbsp;and subsequently signed a first look television production development deal with the network. But yes, she continued acting throughout that time as well, and you’ve seen her in&nbsp;<em>Upstream Color</em>,&nbsp;<em>Alien: Covenant</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Killing</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wild Nights with Emily</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pet Sematary</em>.</p> <p>But the movie that Amy chose to discuss has nothing to do with any of that! She's chosen&nbsp;<em>The Peanut Butter Solution</em>, a Canadian children's movie from the eighties that most people thought they dreamed up. April and Amy dissect the crazy plot and how something this unconventional could be made for children. Amy discusses working on her debut&nbsp;<em>Sun Don't Shine</em>, collaborating with Hiro Murai and Donald Glover on&nbsp;<em>Atlanta</em>, and being directed by Madeleine Olnek on&nbsp;<em>Wild Nights with Emily</em>.

        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>To quote the Tribeca Film Festival, director Nia DaCosta is “a name you’re gonna need to get familiar with.” Nia DaCosta was born and raised in New York City and attended NYU’s Tisch. She started her film career paying her dues in production, on the documentary series,&nbsp;<em>Ke$ha: My Crazy Beautiful Life</em>, while also writing and directing shorts. In 2015, she took an early draft of her script for a film called&nbsp;<em>Little Woods</em>&nbsp;to the Sundance Directors Lab. There, she hooked up with Tessa Thompson, who read the part of a woman named Ollie, who’s caught in a poverty trap in rural North Dakota and must decide whether she’ll re-enter a life of crime to help her pregnant sister. Tessa Thompson continued with the project, and Nia then cast Lily James to play her sister. The film premiered in 2018 at the Tribeca Film Festival. Shortly after that, it was announced that Nia would be directing the “spiritual sequel” to&nbsp;<em>Candyman</em>&nbsp;off a script penned by Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld, which will be released by MGM.</p> <p>The movie Nia has chosen to discuss is 1979's&nbsp;<em>Alien</em>. To quote Nia, "it's a perfect film." She and April discuss the revolutionary character of Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, and how the world had never seen someone like her before. Nia talks about working and collaborating with Tessa Thompson on her character in&nbsp;<em>Little Woods</em>. She elaborates on directing the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Candyman</em>and what she learned from Jordan Peele. Plus, Nia tells April how Tessa Thompson is excellent at acting with her hands, or as Nia calls it - "hacting."</p> <p>You should check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKCxFp262uY"><em>Little Woods</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters on April 19.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ5lPt9edzQ"><em>Alien</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/NiaDaCosta">Nia DaCosta</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Roxann got her first job playing Diana Morales in the Broadway production of&nbsp;<em>A Chorus Line</em>. But fans probably know her best for her role as B'Elanna Torres in&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>.&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>&nbsp;offered her the first opportunity to direct and she proceeded to direct 10 episodes of the next Star Trek series,&nbsp;<em>Enterprise</em>. Since then, she’s directed&nbsp;<em>The Deuce</em>,&nbsp;<em>House of Cards</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Americans</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Path</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bates Motel</em>,&nbsp;<em>Crossing Jordan</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost</em>&nbsp;and many others. She will also be directing the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Morning Show</em>, starring Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carrell, and Jennifer Aniston. She makes her feature film directing debut with&nbsp;<em>Breakthrough</em>, starring Chrissy Metz, Josh Lucas, and Topher Grace, an adaptation of Joyce Smith’s memoir,&nbsp;<em>The Impossible: The Miraculous Story of a Mother’s Faith and Her Child’s Resurrection</em>.</p> <p>The movie that Roxann has chosen to discuss is, kind of, the exact inverse of her own upcoming film - 1956's&nbsp;<em>The Bad Seed</em>. Maintaining such a prolific acting and directing career, Roxann has so much insight into the craft of acting. She discusses how actors often think that by making "small" acting decisions they are being more authentic, when in reality these decisions are just "lazy" and "boring." She also expresses her belief that the characters in a film should not be discussing the philosophical ideas of the movie, but rather, the film should inspire discussion from the audience. And of course, she talks all about her role as the half-human, half-Klingon, B'Elanna Torres, and what that role has meant not just to fans, but to her personally.</p> <p>You should check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52bORzIODec"><em>Breakthrough</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters on April 17.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooy8HTb8izw"><em>The Bad Seed</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/roxdaws">Roxann Dawson</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </p><p>Julia Hart was a school teacher for eight years before she quit to make a go of screenwriting. Her debut screenplay,&nbsp;<em>The Keeping Room</em>, landed on the 2012 Black List and was made into a feature directed by Daniel Barber (<em>Harry Brown</em>) and starring Brit Marling, Hailee Steinfeld and Sam Worthington. Julia's directorial debut,&nbsp;<em>Miss Stevens</em>, is based on Julia’s experience as a teacher. It starred Lily Rabe, Timothee Chalamet, Lili Reinhart, and Rob Huebel.</p> <p>In 2018, Julia’s second feature,&nbsp;<em>Fast Color</em>, debuted at SXSW. It tells the story of a family of women afflicted/blessed with a mysterious power and stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Lorraine Toussaint, and David Straithairn. Most recently, Julia directed and co-wrote (with Jordan Horowitz)&nbsp;<em>Star Girl</em>for Disney, starring Grace Vanderwall and based on the best-selling book by Jerry Spinelli.</p> <p>Although Julia only recently saw&nbsp;<em>One False Move</em>, she was shocked at how thematically similar her film&nbsp;<em>Fast Color</em>&nbsp;compares to it. She and April discuss the use of violence in cinema, and how a filmmaker can make it have an emotional impact on the audience. Julia also reveals how she rewrites her scripts once the films have been cast in order to tailor the role to the actor.

They are on the program this week for a very special Max Fun Drive episode talking about David Cronenberg's masterpiece,&nbsp;<em>Dead Ringers</em>. The sisters are avid Cronenberg devotees and, not to mention, this film centers around identical twins Beverly and Elliot Mantle. The pairing of guest and movie is truly a match made in heaven. The sisters also discuss what went into making their body modification horror,&nbsp;<em>American Mary</em>, and why agents and managers warn actors about working with them.</p> <p>And in celebration of the Max Fun Drive, we have an additional segment this week. April talks to writer and filmmaker Michele Meek about her new book,&nbsp;<em>Independent Female Filmmakers: A Chronicle Through Interviews, Profiles, and Manifestos</em>.

        <p>

        </p><p>Debra was a Boston independent filmmaker before she picked up and left for NYU’s graduate film program. Her first short film there, “Snake Feed,” was accepted into the Sundance Labs, where she developed the concept into her first narrative feature,&nbsp;<em>Down to the Bone</em>, starring Vera Fermiga. From there, Debra and her creative partner Anne Rossellini developed a film based on Daniel Woodrell’s 2006 novel,&nbsp;<em>Winter's Bone</em>. The film was released in 2010 and tells the story of a girl who’s the sole caretaker of her family who must hunt down her missing father to avoid being kicked out of her house and losing everything. The girl was played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence was nominated for an Academy Award, as was Debra’s film and screenplay. In 2018, she directed&nbsp;<em>Leave No Trace</em>, a story about a father with PTSD trying to raise his teen daughter off the grid when some well-meaning people intervene and change the course of their lives. Starring Ben Foster and newcomer Thomasin Mckenzie Harcourt,&nbsp;<em>Leave No Trace</em>&nbsp;has been on multiple Top Ten lists, and won Debra the Best Director award at the 2019 LAFCA awards ceremony.</p> <p>The film that Debra has chosen to discuss is Samuel Fuller's classic noir,&nbsp;<em>Pickup on South Street</em>. This is a personal favorite of Debra's and it becomes clear with how much appreciation and thought she has for the film. Debra discusses how she is able to create realistic dialogue for people who aren't from her "bougie, liberal" world. She talks about working with actress Dale Dickey, and why people love watching her on screen. Debra also elaborates on the use of guns in cinema, how we rely on them to tell stories, and how she is trying to "restore meaning to the woundable body."</p> <p>You can watch&nbsp;<em>Leave No Trace</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCQHRD6?camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B07FCQHRD6&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=justwatch09-20">Amazon Prime</a>.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7an4CToF5g"><em>Pickup on South Street</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0335138/">Debra Granik</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

Between working on shows such as Broad City, Nurse Jackie and Damages, Katie's already worked on over 300 episodes of television. She’s currently producing the documentary feature <em>Street Fighting Men</em>, which will be distributed by First Run Features later this year.

The series has been showcased by MovieMaker Magazine, Script Magazine, Tumblr and Funny or Die.</p> <p>The movie that Katie has chosen to discuss this week is the vampire mockumentary, <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>. Katie and April discuss the improvisational style of the film and how it contrasts with that of Amy Sedaris on her show, At Home With Amy Sedaris. They also dissect the anatomy of comedy; how jokes can age badly, what makes a physical joke work, and grounding comedy in reality. Plus, they discuss vampire movies in general, and how even though something's been made a million time, it can be made unique by simply adding a personal touch.</p> <p>You can watch 'At Home with Amy Sedaris' on <a href="https://www.trutv.com/shows/at-home-with-amy-sedaris/index.html"> truTV</a> in theaters now.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv568AzZ-i8"><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em></a>.</p> <p>With <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/katietibaldi?lang=en">Katie Tibaldi</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on <a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at <a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a> and <a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a> for <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

          70 'Ex Machina' with 'Mapplethorpe' and 'Dig!' Director Ondi Timoner
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Ondi is a Floridian, born in Miami, but she studied film, literature, and theater at Yale University. Her 2004 documentary&nbsp;<em>Dig!</em>&nbsp;made waves on the indie circuit, winning her the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.&nbsp;<em>Dig!</em>&nbsp;followed two indie bands — The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols — on a journey that would bring art and commerce to collision points. She then directed&nbsp;<em>Join Us</em>before returning to Sundance with 2009’s documentary&nbsp;<em>We Live in Public</em>, about the work of Josh Harris, an “internet visionary” and dot-com entrepreneur who was one of the most prominent people to sacrifice his privacy and peace for a very public internet life.&nbsp;<em>We Live in Public</em>&nbsp;also took home the Grand Jury Prize, making her the sole director to do it twice. This year, though, she’s releasing her first narrative feature,&nbsp;<em>Mapplethorpe</em>, a look at the life of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe from his rise to fame in the 1970s to his untimely death in 1989.</p> <p>The movie that Ondi chose to discuss this week is Alex Garland's&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina</em>. Based on her work with Josh Harris, Ondi has some fascinating things to say about the terrifying rise of A.I. and how we will inevitably be overtaken by machines. She elaborates on shooting her latest feature,&nbsp;<em>Mapplethorpe</em>, in just 19 days and how that frenetic energy seeped into the film - which is a good thing. Ondi reveals that for her, behind every creation there must be love. And lastly, she discusses the role of the director, as conductor, and the necessity of collaboration with the many departments on a film.</p> <p>You can watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvXLMpjyqpU"><em>Mapplethorpe</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters now.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bggUmgeMCdc"><em>Ex Machina</em></a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80023689">Netflix</a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/onditimoner?lang=en">Ondi Timoner</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

          69 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' with 'Shirkers' Director Sandi Tan
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Born in Singapore, Sandi began her career as a film critic at The Straits Times, Singapore’s largest newspaper. She then threw that all away to run off to film school at Columbia University. Sandi most recently wrote, directed, produced, and co-edited&nbsp;<em>Shirkers</em>&nbsp;(2018) which won the World Cinema Documentary Directing Award after its Sundance 2018 premiere. It was picked up as a Netflix Original Documentary and was on the shortlist for the 2019 Best Documentary Academy award.&nbsp;<em>Shirkers</em>&nbsp;reconstructs the story of an unfinished feature film Sandi made as a teenager using actual footage from the film combined with personal interrogations exploring how exactly the film came to be before it went missing.</p> <p>The movie that Sandi chose to discuss this week is David Lynch's&nbsp;<em>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</em>. Although this film may not seem to have much to do with her own film,&nbsp;<em>Shirkers</em>, throughout the conversation she and April discover a great deal of overlap. Both movies are steeped in murder, reconciling the past, and mysterious disappearing male figures. Sandi details the incredible story of how she came to make the documentary. And she and April explore the intuitive filmmaking of David Lynch, and why he wanted to tell Laura Palmer's side of the story.</p> <p>You can watch&nbsp;<em>Shirkers</em>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80241061?source=35">Netflix</a>.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Ey1FQVIO8"><em>Twin Peaks: Fire Walks with Me</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sanditan">Sandi Tan</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Tchaiko graduated from Columbia University before going on to intern for Spike Lee and Mira Nair. While assisting directors George C. Wolfe and Tom Vaughan she directed several short-form projects, including&nbsp;<em>America's Shadows: HIV Risk in Black &amp; Latino Youth</em>. In 2012, she wrote the script called&nbsp;<em>Solace</em>, which would eventually become her feature debut. At that time, it was a semi-finalist for the Sundance Writers Lab. In 2015, the project became a recipient of the Panavision New Filmmakers Program.&nbsp;<em>Solace</em>&nbsp;premiered at the LA Film Festival 2018, winning Special Jury Mention Best Ensemble Cast. Tchaiko was a 2017 School of Making Thinking resident fellow where she created the VR film&nbsp;<em>Shapeshifters</em>. In between her independent projects she produces and directs commercials and branded content.</p> <p>The movie that Tchaiko has chosen to discuss this week is the wonderful, wacky, goblin-y,&nbsp;<em>Labyrinth</em>. April and Tchaiko touch upon the arousing gender fluidity of David Bowie's character "Jerith." Tchaiko talks about how she strives to make "imperfect" films. She also elaborates on being inspired by nature in the writing of her next fantasy film. Plus, there's a lot of puppet talk - from the construction to the puppeteering itself.

          67 'Head' with 'B.C. Butcher' Director Kansas Bowling
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>Kansas is a born-and-raised-in-Hollywood writer and director. She wrote her first feature when she was only 15, and then went on to direct it for release at 17. The film, titled,&nbsp;<em>B.C. Butcher</em>, is a “pre-historic slasher” starring Kato Kaelin.&nbsp;<em>B.C. Butcher</em>&nbsp;was distributed by Troma Entertainment, and Kansas was inducted into the Troma Institute for Gifted Youth. Since then, she has directed 25 music videos for artists including Collapsing Scenery, Boyd Rice, Iggy Pop, and the Death Valley Girls. Aside from directing, Kansas also acts. She’s appeared in more than 30 projects, including the upcoming directorial debut of Glenn Danzig, and also Quentin Tarantino’s&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Time In Hollywood</em>. She also starred in a short film series called 'Curious Females', which premiered on Refinery29 in 2017.</p> <p>The movie that Kansas has chosen to discuss on this week's episode is the 1968 freak-out fest by The Monkees called,&nbsp;<em>Head</em>. It's evident immediately that Kansas has a deep love for The Monkees and this film. She points out that The Monkees were very self aware in the film, as they comment on being "wind-up dolls" meant to distract people from the Vietnam war. She describes how her favorite films have a frenetic editing style, like&nbsp;<em>Head</em>, and also incorporate elements of "artistic non-fiction." Kansas covers some of her craziest experiences working on her own movies, like getting Kato Kaelin to appear in her film&nbsp;<em>B.C. Butcher</em>&nbsp;for free when she was only seventeen. Or like the time she called up Iggy Pop and asked if he'd be in a music video - and he said yes. If there's anything you should take away from this interview, it's that it never hurts to ask.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxsSH4NhXMc"><em>B.C.

          66 'Don't Look Now' with 'Untogether' Director Emma Forrest
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>What a fascinating episode we have in store for you this week. We are so lucky to be joined by writer/director, Emma Forrest. Emma has lived a life. She started out as very young journalist in London, when at the age of 15, she wrote a lauded story on Madonna for The Sunday Times, which prompted her to leave school at 16 to become a full-time writer for the Times. In 1998, she moved into writing fiction with the publication of her novel&nbsp;<em>Namedropper</em>. From there Emma began writing screenplays, selling one to Plan B, another to Miramax, and subsequently being named by Variety as one of the "Top Ten Screenwriters to Watch in 2009." Emma, however, has taken her screenwriting into her own hands and in 2018 debuted her first feature,&nbsp;<em>Untogether</em>, at the TriBeca Film Festival.&nbsp;<em>Untogether</em>&nbsp;stars Jemima and Lola Kirke, Ben Mendelsohn, Jamie Dornan, and Billy Crystal, and tells the story of two sisters in the middle of their own artistic and life crises — one a recovering addict, and the other in a withering relationship she doesn’t understand but can’t let go of.</p> <p>In addition to discussing her newest film, Emma has chosen to talk about Nicolas Roeg's&nbsp;<em>Don't Look Now</em>. Emma describes how she feels so connected to this film - having seen it at an inappropriately young age and also being burdened by the feelings of premonitions. She and April admire all the incredibly unique aspects of the film - the writing, editing, cinematography, and even the performances of the leads Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. Emma even notes the similarities between&nbsp;<em>Don't Look Now</em>&nbsp;and her own film,&nbsp;<em>Untogether</em>, in how both movies take place in cities that seem to know the fates of the protagonists before the characters do. Emma also opens up about the difficulties of working on her newest release, in particular having to direct her ex-husband Ben Mendelsohn while they were going through a divorce, and how that emotion on set powered many of the performances in the film.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzVIGYsxdiw"><em>Untogether</em></a>&nbsp;in select theaters and streaming on February 8th.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/dont-look-now"><em>Don't Look Now</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/GirlInterrupter">Emma Forrest</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

She's on the program this week to discuss&nbsp;<em>The Wiz</em>. She and April begin the conversation by fawning over the performance of the one and only Diana Ross as Dorothy. They also cover the technical prowess of director Sidney Lumet, and why he considers this film somewhat of a failure. The conversation then turns towards DeMane's work as a TV director. They go in depth on what a day on set actually looks like. DeMane tells a story about a time when the producers of her feature&nbsp;<em>Lift</em>&nbsp;brought on another editor. But she also stresses that the most important thing is getting your work out in to the world. And lastly, DeMane emphasizes the lessons she learned from&nbsp;<em>The Wiz</em>&nbsp;about believing in yourself, and that when you are comfortable and confident in the work that you're doing, that's when you become really dangerous.</p> <p>You can see DeMane's episode of&nbsp;<a href="https://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder">How to Get Away with Murder</a>&nbsp;on February 14.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGtnHaEK66s"><em>The Wiz</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DeManeDavis">DeMane Davis</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

Her new film,&nbsp;<em>Close</em>, stars Noomi Rapace as a counter-terrorism expert and bodyguard tasked to protect a wealthy heiress. It's a gritty, intimate action film, and that's why the movie Vicky has chosen to discuss is so apt. This week Vicky will be discussing 2002's,&nbsp;<em>The Bourne Identity</em>. Vicky elaborates on the influence this film had on her, and how the Bourne series has had a huge influence on the current iterations of the Bond movies. Vicky goes in depth on mapping out action sequences and working with stunt coordinators to achieve a spontaneous feel in her film. She also talks about working with Noomi Rapace, and why it was difficult for her to call "cut."

Her most recent documentary,&nbsp;<em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em>, follows the story of a young girl in a tight-knit LDS community, who is abducted twice by her neighbor and parent's best friend. It's an intense and serious film, which makes Skye's chosen genre movie all the more interesting. She has decided to discuss 2015's Polish, horror, mermaid musical,&nbsp;<em>The Lure</em>. She and April pinpoint how this film is able to deftly deliver harsh truths about female sexualization within the framework of a mythic fairytale. The two also marvel at the director Agnieszka Smoczynska, and what she was able to do in terms of pushing the limits of the mermaid's fin designs. Skye also touches upon working with the Broberg family on her doc, and how she was able to get them to discuss incredibly difficult subjects like pedophilia and child abuse.</p> <p>You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLC-Fgfz6n4"><em>Abducted in Plain Sight</em></a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.netflix.com/search?q=Abducted&amp;jbv=81000864&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0">Netflix</a>.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-4RqQwsmmA"><em>The Lure</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/skyeborgman">Skye Borgman</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/switchbladesisters/">Facebook</a>.</p> <p>Or email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org">switchbladesisters@maximumfun.org</a>.</p> <p>Produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/caseyobrien">Casey O'Brien</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://maximumfun.org/laura-swisher">Laura Swisher</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>.</p>

She and April point out how this film is a precursor to shows like 'The Good Place.' Logan elaborates on working with actors and getting past the intimidation phase. She discusses convincing people to invest in her first feature, even though she'd never directed one before. Logan also talks about working on that debut feature,&nbsp;<em>Operator</em>, starring Martin Starr and Mae Whitman.

Jen takes April deep into the world of filmmaking as she discusses the concept of "process dictating product." They examine the differences between making films in Europe and the US. They break down the genius of Jonathan Glazer and the exact steps he took to complete this film. Jen explains what it's like pitching as a director for hire.

          60 'Point Break' with 'Alaska Is a Drag' Director Shaz Bennett
        </h4>
        <p>

        </p><p>This week we've got writer and director Shaz Bennett on the program to talk about Kathryn Bigelow's classic,&nbsp;<em>Point Break</em>. As Shaz says on the show, this is the movie she most wishes she had directed. She and April also discuss Shaz's newest film,&nbsp;<em>Alaska Is a Drag</em>, which follows an aspiring drag queen turned boxer stuck working at a cannery in Alaska. The two of them dissect the masterful directing of Bigelow during the visceral chase scenes. They look at the unconventional casting of Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves. They praise the performance and genius of Lori Petty. And Shaz elaborates on being yourself while directing, and being close to your actors on set. April has a special connection with this film as well, having written a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/stream-this-movie-point-break-717570/">retrospective</a>for Rolling Stone last year.</p> <p>If you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLKyFCooGhM"><em>Point Break</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/shazbennett">Shaz Bennett</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">@SwitchbladePod</a>&nbsp;on Twitter.

        </p><p>This episode specializes in creepy haunted houses with potentially crazy women living inside them. And who better to have on the show than director and actor, Bridey Elliott. She's on to discuss her new film&nbsp;<em>Clara's Ghost</em>. Her film features Bridey's own mother, Paula Niedert Elliott, playing Clara, an isolated woman who begins seeing a ghost around the house. And appropriately, the film Bridey chose to discuss today is&nbsp;<em>Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</em>&nbsp;starring Bette Davis. Davis' character Charlotte&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;believes she's seeing ghosts in her family's plantation home. These movies work well together thematically as they both touch upon paranoia, disbelief of women, and a real confusion on who is actually going crazy. Bridey talks about making her new film with her entire family, including her mother who had never acted before. She even shares a story about how she was able to shoot a scene with a naked woman walking around her childhood neighborhood. April and she also discuss the history of&nbsp;<em>Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</em>, all the behind the scenes drama, and how this is a feminist film.</p> <p>Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm16F8A7pdI"><em>Clara's Ghost</em></a>&nbsp;in theaters and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/claras-ghost">streaming</a>.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZmWBSA8tHk"><em>Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/brideylee">Bridey Elliott</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">@SwitchbladePod</a>&nbsp;on Twitter.

        </p><p>We've got a truly fascinating conversation on this week's episode with 'Dirty John' showrunner Alexandra Cunningham. Her new show is based upon the wildly popular LA Times true crime podcast of the same name. It deals with deception, seduction, and intrigue. These are all themes found in the film that Alexandra chose to discuss, the 1945 technicolor noir classic&nbsp;<em>Leave Her to Heaven</em>. As 'Dirty John' deals with the mind of a manipulative conman, Alexandra has become somewhat of an expert on the mindset of villains. And she has some enlightening words on Gene Tierney's coldhearted Ellen in&nbsp;<em>Leave Her to Heaven</em>. Alex comes from a playwriting background and explains how she learned to show rather than to tell. April and she dissect the famous drowning scene in the film. And Alex has a fascinating story about working for a suicide hotline, and reveals how sometimes the scariest things happen in the light of day.</p> <p>Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-dUiO1ZV1s"><em>Dirty John</em></a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bravotv.com/dirty-john">Bravo</a>.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR6p5HcfCpc"><em>Leave Her to Heaven</em></a>.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1017827/">Alexandra Cunningham</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">@SwitchbladePod</a>&nbsp;on Twitter.

        </p><p>A great new episode coming your way with the director of the new road comedy&nbsp;<em>The Long Dumb Road</em>, Hannah Fidell. Her film follows the sheltered Nat (played by Tony Revolori) as he drives cross country to attend art school in Los Angeles. On his way he picks up a hitchhiker (played by Jason Mantzoukas) who shakes up Nat's close minded worldview.</p> <p>The movie that Hannah has chosen to discuss this week is Michael Haneke's&nbsp;<em>Funny Games</em>. She sort of picks both the American and Austrian version since they are almost perfectly identical films. April calls Hannah's own film&nbsp;<em>The Long Dumb Road</em>&nbsp;a comedic&nbsp;<em>Funny Games</em>, since both deal with an intruder breaking the unwritten rules of politeness and social decency. Hannah and April really dig into the genius of Haneke and his masterful filmmaking. They elaborate on how&nbsp;<em>Funny Games</em>is eerily prescient in its prediction of the emergence of "alt-right trolls." April also reveals that this movie was somewhat born out of Haneke's hatred for&nbsp;<em>Natural Born Killers</em>&nbsp;and how this Austrian film was really intended for American audiences.</p> <p>Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjbsEZEfEEo"><em>The Long Dumb Road</em></a>&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-long-dumb-road">now</a>.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<em>Funny Games</em>, either the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rzfAkTZq5Y">Austrian</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3o49aoh8t8">American</a>&nbsp;version.</p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/holafidel">Hannah Fidell</a></p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">@SwitchbladePod</a>&nbsp;on Twitter.

She discusses how she got started as a TV writer, what she did to get hired, and what kind of pilot's people are looking to read.

The movie that Suzi has decided to discuss is 2006's Korean monster masterpiece,&nbsp;<em>The Host</em>. While maybe not immediately recognizable as an influence, Suzi explains that director Bong Joon-ho's focus on character and relationships has had a great effect on her work. She and April go over the process of pitching a movie that's never been made before, and the kind of work that goes into those types of meetings. Suzi also elaborates on working with John Hawkes and Melissa Leo. She even explains how it was difficult to cast John Hawkes because he doesn't have an email address.

The movie Jenna picked is 2005's&nbsp;<em>The Skeleton Key</em>. While many have probably forgotten about this movie, we certainly haven't.

Jenna dives deep on the process of making her debut feature.

        </p><p>If you listen to this episode you don't have to go to film school. Our guest this week is Daisy von Scherler Mayer. You may know her best for her "debut tour de force"&nbsp;<em>Party Girl</em>. She is a prolific television director who has worked on everything from&nbsp;<em>Mad Men</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Orange Is The New Black</em>. The movie she has chosen to talk about this week is one of her favorite films, Bob Fosse's&nbsp;<em>All That Jazz</em>. Daisy takes April through exactly how this film has influenced her life, and even names specific scenes she has stolen from the movie (a practice she heartily encourages for film students). Daisy does a wonderful job of explaining how she speaks to actors and creates a supportive environment for them. This episode is also particularly enlightening as Daisy and April really get into the creative process and the emotional rollercoaster it can be. She also discusses the genius of Bob Fosse and how he was able to create a "perfect film." This episode is required listening for anyone who wants to be filmmaker.

In 2014, she was selected for the Sundance Institute Screenwriters Intensive and her debut feature,&nbsp;<em>Jinn</em>, won the Special Jury Recognition Award for screenwriting at the 2018 SXSW Film Festival.&nbsp;<em>Jinn</em>&nbsp;tells the story of a high school senior whose mother becomes taken by the beliefs and practices of Islam, which sets up a series of trials for the girl as she tries to navigate her own belief systems. The central character uses dance as a type of release. So it's fitting that the film Nijla has chosen to discuss is Darren Aronofsky's&nbsp;<em>Black Swan</em>. April and she explore the different ways that Nijla's film and Aronofsky's film use dance as a form of expression for the protagonists. Nijla also describes how she relates to Natalie Portman's character Nina Sayers in her pursuit of perfection. Plus, Nijla elaborates on her desire to honor her community in the representation of Islam in her film&nbsp;<em>Jinn</em>.</p> <p>Check out the trailer for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQc58eJSWLE"><em>Jinn</em></a>.

The genre film that she has chosen to discuss is Terry Gilliam's weirdo time travel movie&nbsp;<em>12 Monkeys</em>. Megan and April really get into the ins and outs of working in independent cinema; from the casting to achieving control on set. Megan discusses how she and Terry Gilliam have the similarity of not working within the Hollywood system; Gilliam living in London while Megan lives in Seattle. She elaborates on her new movie&nbsp;<em>Sadie</em>&nbsp;and shooting in a trailer park with Melanie Lynskey. April and she also cover shooting nudity and the need for the actors to be completely comfortable. This is a great conversation that proves you don't have to work within the confines of Hollywood in order to be a successful filmmaker.</p> <p>Check out the trailer for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPQFZXDhdrg"><em>Sadie</em></a>&nbsp;which is in theaters now.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen it yet, go watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15s4Y9ffW_o"><em>12 Monkeys</em></a></p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/thecinechick">Megan Griffiths</a>.</p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">@SwitchbladePod</a>&nbsp;on Twitter.

Erikka discusses her documentary career and what is like having to do research for films with such dark subject matter. She goes on to talk about having to go through footage from 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, and how it's still important to offer some hope in even the most depressing of films. She also elaborates on her love for the movie&nbsp;<em>Matilda</em>&nbsp;and how it is rooted in the fact that the parents are so mean to the main character. April and her cover the directing career of Danny Devito and the history behind his production company Jersey Films.

April welcomes one of the filmmakers from the festival, Amanda Kramer, to discuss the Rainer Werner Fassbinder masterpiece,&nbsp;<em>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant</em>. Amanda's film&nbsp;<em>Ladyworld</em>&nbsp;screened right before the recording of this episode. The day also marks her birthday! April and Amanda note that both of the films in this discussion share a similar theme of hysterical women trapped in a confined space. Amanda talks about her love of melodramatic performances and pushing her actresses to reach beyond realism. She also coins a term for her type of filmmaking: "Tamponnui." Plus, she discusses the fact that she never uses a camera, rarely bathes, and would happily be crowned "The Female Fassbinder."</p> <p>Check out the trailer here for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lVrGz8rX3c"><em>Ladyworld</em></a>.</p> <p>And if you haven't seen it yet, go watch on&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/159493384"><em>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant</em></a></p> <p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/aprilwolfe">April Wolfe</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.afilmbyamandakramer.com/">Amanda Kramer</a></p> <p>You can let us know what you think of Switchblade Sisters at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/switchbladepod">@SwitchbladePod</a>&nbsp;on Twitter.

She has chosen, maybe, one of the most fun and fascinating movies we've discussed on the show, 1982's cult classic,&nbsp;<em>Basket Case</em>. The story follows a young man named Duayne, who keeps his formerly conjoined, mutant brother Belial in a picnic basket. Duayne and Belial move to New York in order to seek out and murder the doctors who surgically separated them. A truly lovely tale that April and Brea fully dissect. They go in depth on what makes this gritty, New York classic just so memorable; the commitment of the actors, the gore, and the execution of the ridiculous concept. Brea also details the life of a working actress. She explains the struggle of acting in a movie that never gets released, returning clothes for an audition to the store, and always carrying around a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This is a truly fun episode that touches upon the honorable practice of making art for the sake of making it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boq_hqxQc0Q"><em>Dead Night</em></a>&nbsp;stars Brea Grant and former Switchblade Sisters guest&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/switchblade-sisters/switchblade-sisters-episode-13-raw-barbara-crampton">Barbara Crampton</a>.
